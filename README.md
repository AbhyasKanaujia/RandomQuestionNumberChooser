# RandomQuestionNumberChooser
Let's say there are 100 question from a chapter. Doing all the question from 1,2,3,...,100 will take forever. Its not very realistic. Only doing the top say 30 will also be a waste since almost all the qustions till 30 will be easy and similar. What if there are different type of questions after 30 that you didn't practive? Doing things at random seems to be a good way but keeping tack of which qusetions are done and taking time to choose questions at random is not very helpful too. So here is my solution that will give question numbers to practice at random.
